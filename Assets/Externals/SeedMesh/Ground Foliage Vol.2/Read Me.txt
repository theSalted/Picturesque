Very Important! you need to import SeedMesh shaders separately, if you did not download it yet, here the links: https://www.artstation.com/a/19987937
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/seedmesh-vegetation-shaders-232690

Do not forget to add the diffusion profiles from package to the Diffusion Profile List in HDRP!!! (It was tested in Unity 2022.3.32 and this step is not necessary)

If you do not do it, you can experiment a "black screen" or the vegetation will not render property 

The easiest way to do this is selecting any Vegetation material, and in the material properties (down in the diffusion profile box) there must be a FIX button.

This Step is about the HDRP workflow! Find more information in the Unity Docs: 
https://docs.unity.cn/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@9.0/manual/Diffusion-Profile.html

Find an unity package to convert shaders from HDRP to URP: Seedmesh > Shader_graph > Pipeline Setup
also, here a video tutorial in case you want to know how to transform shaders by yourself using shader graph, this video can be skipped https://youtu.be/2qqS1mpb3vU
